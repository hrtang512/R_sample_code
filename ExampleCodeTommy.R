# This is an R function named elevator, which takes an argument of a n Ã— 3 
# matrix named x which contains all the requests as described below, and returns 
# the time when the last guest arrives his/her destination.

# At time t = 0, the elevators is resting at level 1.

# Input: There are n requests x1, . . . , xn. Each xi is a triple
# xi = (ti, si, di), which means that a guest made a request at time ti > 0 at 
# level si, and the guest is going to level di.

# Rule 1: 
# It keeps going in one direction until there is no guest in it, and there is no 
# other guest waiting to be served at a further level in the current direction.

# Rule 2: 
# It will collect guests that are going in the same direction along the way.

# Rule 3:
# After it stopped going in one direction, it will turn around and go in the 
#opposite direction, if there are any pending requests from guests.

# Rule 4: 
# It takes one unit time to move up or down a level, and takes one unit 
# time to stop at a level for all the guests to enter and/or exit (if any).
